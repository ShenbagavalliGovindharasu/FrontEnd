                  <h2>Emerland</h2>
                <p>Emerald Lake is situated in Emerald Village, around 20-22 kilometres from the main city of Ooty and is a part of the Silent Valley National Park in the Nilgiris District. Serene and away from the maddening crowd, the lake and its surroundings are much cleaner and offer a perfect place to enjoy a leisurely time in the vicinity of nature and quietude.

                    It is one of the unexplored and virgin places of the South Indian hill station, not yet encroached by the masses of tourists that visit the place every year. Emerald Lake is the ideal spot in Ooty for nature lovers. Tourists usually flock there for the picturesque scenic beauty of the lake, and the green Nilgiri slopes and tea plantations surrounding it. It is a paradise for nature photography enthusiasts as the delightful landscape offers a perfect subject and composition. </p>
              <h2>Places</h2>
                    <li> The tourists and picnickers who come here enjoy the abundance of flora and fauna. They can have fun feeding the fish which gather in groups along the bank of the lake or let the children do it while they capture the beautiful moments. Photography here is absolutely free.</li>
                   <li>  Emerald Lake is home to a number of colourful native birds. Bird-lovers and ornithologists can spend hours here studying and observing different types of aerial and aquatic birds which flock here in groups. The place has the silence and peace required for the devoted hobby or job of bird-watching.</li>
                <li>The lake is perfect for those who are into Nature Photography, with an open sky, blue water and lush green all around serving as brilliant frames for capturing.</li>
